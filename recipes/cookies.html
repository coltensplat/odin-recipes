    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 170C and line two baking trays with baking paper</li>
            <li>Using a stand mixer on medium speed, cream 
                the butter and sugar togehter for about 3 minutes until soft and pale. 
                Add the egg and mix for a further minue. Add the flour and mix with a rubber spatula until just combined, 
                then beat thoroughly. Stir in the chocolate chips or whatever.
            </li>
            <li>If you have time, cover the mixture and chill for 1 hour before 
                baking. Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and arrange on the trays, 
                leaving space between them as they will spread during baking.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for about 12 minutes, or until the cookies are firm and golden brown at the edges. Leave 
                to cool on the baking trays; the cookies will firm further as they cool.
            </li>
        </ol>
