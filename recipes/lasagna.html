    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter for greasing</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups Lady Caterina's Ragu</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh mozzarella torn into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>A brick to chop down</li>
            <li>3 hard-cooked eggs finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups bechamel</li>
            <li>2 cups finely grated Parmiagiano-Reggiano</li>
            <li>Some foreign bullshit, the noodle shit;
                cut that shit into 4 sheets measuring the size of your
                baking dish nigga, or about a pound of store-bought
                pasta sheets.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Follow these steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Spoon a half cup layer of ragu on the bottom of the baking dish
                Place a pasta sheet on top. There's no need to cook the pasta
                in advance. It will cook in the juices of the ragu. Spoon
                anotehr half cup of ragu over the pasta. Distribute a quater of the 
                mozzarella, quater of the chopped eggs, half cup of bechamel, and half cup of
                Parmiagiano-Reggiano evenly over the tray. Repeat the pasta, ragu, 
                mozzarella, egg, bechamel, and Parmiagiano-Reggiano layering
                three more times. Layer the remaining ragu, mozzarella, bechamel
                and Parmiagiano-Reggiano over the final pasta layer.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes nigga. 
                Uncover the baking dish, then continue baking until the edges of the pasta are
                curled up and browned, 30 to 40 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Allow the lasanga to rest for about 30 minutes before serving in slices</li>
        </ol>
